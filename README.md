# Soft Bun

Soft Bun is a lightweight and framework-agnostic reactivity library for JavaScript and TypeScript projects. It allows you to easily introduce reactivity into your applications, enabling automatic updates and dynamic behavior based on changes to your state.

## Features

- **Reactivity**: Define reactive dependencies between variables in your state object using expressions.
- **Automatic Updates**: Soft Bun automatically recalculates dependent values when their dependencies change, ensuring your data is always up to date.
- **Framework-Agnostic**: Soft Bun can be seamlessly integrated into any JavaScript or TypeScript project, regardless of the framework or library being used.
- **Simple API**: With a concise and intuitive API, Soft Bun makes it easy to introduce reactivity into your codebase without adding unnecessary complexity.

## Installation

You can install Soft Bun using npm or Yarn:

```shell
npm install soft-bun
```

or

```shell
yarn add soft-bun
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use Soft Bun:

```javascript
import SoftBun from 'soft-bun';

const data = {a: 2, b: 1};
const state = new SoftBun(data);

state.reactive('c', '1 + $a * $b');

console.log(state.state.c); // Output: 3

state.state.a = 3;

console.log(state.state.c); // Output: 4
```

In the above example, we create a new `SoftBun` instance with an initial data object. We define a reactive dependency using the `reactive` method, which computes the value of `c` based on the variables `a` and `b`. Whenever `a` or `b` changes, Soft Bun automatically updates the value of `c`.
